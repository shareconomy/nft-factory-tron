Recompiles all contracts and deployes them using 1_NFTactory_migration.js file
```source .env && tronbox migrate --reset --network shasta``` 

Before running tests, you need to start Tronbox-quickstart node by running:

``` docker run -it -p 9090:9090 --rm --name tron -e "defaultBalance=1000000" -e "mnemonic=jacket acoustic more any text engine giraffe other turkey popular grab style" trontools/quickstart ```

It starts local "development" TVM, where contracts would be deployed during tests
Each account would have balance equal 1000000 TRX and would be generated by same mnemonic
